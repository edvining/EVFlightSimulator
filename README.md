# EchoVictorFlightSimulator

This is the start of the OpenGL Flight Simulator made by me, Edward Vining (aka Echo Victor).

I am aiming to make this a highly realistic, very performant, OpenGL / Vulkan application, written in C++. 

This allows me to take full advantage of the computer hardware, as C++ is as close to directly coding the hardware itself.

Khronos OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is an Open-Source graphics library, enabling direct rendering to the screen, and whilst not as verbose as Vulkan, still enables good levels of performance.

Khronos Vulkan is also an Open-Source graphics library, with almost everything exposed to the user, making it incredibly verbose to write, but enabling better performance capabilities.
